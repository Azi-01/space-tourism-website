## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

While building this project I learnt how to use grid and flexbox together and how to work using mobile-first workflow approach.

### Continued development

This website still has a lot of room for improvements. I would like to work on my approach to write better and maintainable css and also get a better at using grid and flexbox.
